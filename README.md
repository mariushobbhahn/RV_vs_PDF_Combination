# Combinations of Random Variables vs Probability Density functions.

I have been slightly confused about combinations of random variables (RV) in contrast to combinations of probability density functions (pdf). If we have, for example, two Gaussian random variables \(X_1\) and \(X_2\) then their sum \(W=X_1+X_2\) is again distributed according to a Gaussian. The sum of their pdfs \(p(x_1) + p(x_2)\), however, is __not__ Gaussian. In contrast, the product of two Gaussian random variables \(Z = X_1 \cdot X_2\) is __not__ Gaussian but the product of their pdfs \(p(x_1) \cdot p(x_2)\) is proportional to another Gaussian.

I wrote a <a href='https://www.mariushobbhahn.com/2021-04-29-RV_vs_pdf/'>blogpost</a> describing everything that's going on in this repository. 

If you have questions or feedback don't hesitate to contact me.
